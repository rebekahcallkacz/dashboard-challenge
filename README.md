## Data
This data is from a study evaluating the diversity and frequency of bacteria in belly buttons (Hulcr, 2012). 

## Method
The purpose of this project is to allow the user to interact with the dataset and draw their own conclusions. In order to do this, the data was loaded into the webpage using D3 and then displayed to the user in an interactive manner. When the page loads, the first sample in the dataset is displayed on the dashboard. The user can then select any sample in the dataset to view on the dashboard.
